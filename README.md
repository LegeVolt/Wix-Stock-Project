# Wix-Stock-Project
This project uses Tableau to analyze Wix stock and presents the findings through multiple visualizations.
The visualizations include a comparison chart with competitors,
a blocks chart of the top 10 shareholders,
a bubble chart highlighting the best and worst trade days,
a pie chart illustrating the number of positive and negative trading days,
and a graph displaying revenue and earnings.
The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Wix stock's performance and shareholder structure.
